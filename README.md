# UniWue Lernplatz Scraper

node.js script to save the occupancy rates of study and working spaces in the libraries of the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

The rates are collected from the university's official [online overview](https://www2.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/UB-Infos/standort_auslastung_en.phtml). The script generates CSV files as `/data/<library-id>/<date>.csv`. It is of the following form:

```
# <library-id> - <library-name> (<library-capacity>)
# <opens-at> - <closes-at>
<time>,<occupancy-rate>
```

The first time the CSV is created, the meta data is generated as comments. All following data entries of the form `<time>,<occupancy-rate>` are added at the end. The `<time>` is of the format `HH:MM`, the `<occupancy-rate>` is saved as a percentage. The university currently returns one of `10`, `20`, ..., `100`. The data are updated irregularly, so the script stores a new value only after updates. It is intended to be used in a cronjob.
