# UniWue Lernplatz Scraper

node.js script to save the occupancy rates of study and working spaces in the libraries of the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

The rates are collected from the university's official [online overview](https://www2.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/UB-Infos/standort_auslastung_en.phtml). The script generates CSV files as `/data/<library-id>/<date>.csv`. It is of the following form:

```
# <library-id> - <library-name> (<library-capacity>)
# <opens-at> - <closes-at>
<time>,<occupancy-rate>
```

The first time the CSV is created, the meta data is generated as comments. All following data entries of the form `<time>,<occupancy-rate>` are added at the end. The `<time>` is of the format `HH:MM`, the `<occupancy-rate>` is saved as a percentage. The university currently returns one of `10`, `20`, ..., `100`. The data are updated irregularly, so the script stores a new value only after updates.

The script is intended to be used in a cronjob. Since the meta-data provided by the [online overview](https://www2.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/UB-Infos/standort_auslastung_en.phtml) is not updated exactly at midnight, we suggest using the following crontab entry:

```crontab
* 6-23 * * * node index.js
```

There is currently not a single library which is longer open than midnight.

## Public Archive

This script has been used since September 2017. A public archive of all records since then can be downloaded from [https://nogatz.net/uniwue-library.tar.gz](https://nogatz.net/uniwue-library.tar.gz).
